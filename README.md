# Portfolio
Week 10 Homework - Update Portfolio and other Repos in order to build toward being employer competitive

## INCOMPLETE - ISSUES - TO DO

1. ISSUE: One of the carosuels on the HPC is not working properly.
2. ISSUE: Plain Jane CSS, needs styling.
3. ISSUE: Only 2 links to portfolio, needs more.
4. Content is incomplete, lots of lorem ipsum

## Objective

## Assignment

### Required Content

* Your Name 

* Links to your GitHub profile & LinkedIn page as well as your email address and phone number

* A link to a PDF of your resume

* List of projects. For each project make sure you have the project title, a link to the deployed version and a link to the code on GitHub

### Design 

The content of the portfolio page is a lot more important than the aesthetics. In addition:

* Mobile-friendliness

* Readability

## Approach

Although we have created three previous versions of our portfolio, using what we learned during the first two weeks. I'm going start from stratch as far as html and css are concerned.

* Bootstrap 4

    * navbar
    * carosuel
    * jumbotron
    * cards
    * grid for mobile-readiness
